
LITTLE-ENDIAN INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING THE ASSEMBLER AND TRACER SOFTWARE

To install the software on Pentium based Linux, and other little endian
	type UNIX machines, follow these steps.

 1. Make a directory, say, tracer, where all the software will go

 2. Place the LtlendNx.zip file in tracer
	(For Apple Linux use BigendNx.zip in stead of LtlendNx.zip).

 3. Unzip this file by typing: unzip LtlendNx.zip (or BigendNx.zip)

 4. Make sure the following files and directories now exist:
	READ_ME       asinstal.sh  examples      release
	bin           exercise      syscalnr.h
	as_src        trce_src

 5. For Pentium based Linux there are binaries available in the bin directory,
        but for the Apple Linux it is necessary to recompile the sources.
        This can be done by typing: asinstal.sh   )*

 6. Change to the tracer/examples directory with cd

 7. Type: 
	t88 HlloWrld
    to run the first example

___________

)* N.B.
   It is assumed that the current version of the C-compiler is called by the
   command "gcc". If that is not the case, change the lines 
	"CC=gcc" 
   in the files
	"as_src/Makefile"
   and
	"trce_src/Makefile"
   in such a way that the current version of the C-compiler is called instead of gcc.

	THE CONTENTS OF THE SOURCE AND BINARY DIRECTORIES

The precompiled sources can be found in the "bin" directory, but for
convenience there is also a copy of the binaries in the "examples" and
"exercise" directories.

The only important difference between the interpreter "s88" and the
tracer "t88" is that the interpreter does not display the tracer window, and
does not accept tracer commands from standard input, but all other steps
independent of the tracing process are identical.

The source code for the assembler is in the directory "as_src". The source
code for the interpreter "s88" and debugger-tracer "t88" is in the directory
"trce_src". If you want to change any of the tools, you have to recompile
them, in which case you need a working C compiler installed. To compile, type:
	asinstal
which calls the command "make" to recompile the sources and put the binaries
in the directories "bin", "examples" and "exercise".
It is assumed that the current version of the C-compiler is called by the
command "gcc". If that is not the case, change the lines containing "gcc" 
in the files "Makefile" in the directories "as_src" and "trce_src" in such a
way that the current version of the C-compiler is called instead of gcc.

Assembler source files have an extension ".s". In order to get a binary
for a source "project.s" the command
	as88 project
should perform the assembly, and generates three files "project.88", which is
the 8088 binary, "project.#" which links the file positions in the source
file to the positions in the binary file, and "project.$", which is just a copy
of the source file which contains also included secondary sources and satisfies
the preferred conventions for the assembly process. The tracer subwindow for
the source file displays the "project.$" version.

Tracing a file is done with the command
	t88 project
which displays the registers, the stack, part of the memory etc. in a set of
windows, such that the execution can be observed. The tracer executes exactly
on assembler command when the return key is hit. Execution stops at command "q"
followed by a return, or when the process itself exits.
Interpretation without tracer window is done with the command 
	s88 project

The entire assembler project uses command line terminal windows. This is
a rather standard procedure for Posix compliant systems, but less usual for
Windows platforms.

Some extra notes on the current implementation, known bugs, and restrictions
can be found in the file "release" in this directory.

The precompiled versions of LtlendNx.zip is developed for Pentium based Linux.
